## Introduction
This dashboard is designed for people looking for a job, thinking about a career change, or switching roles. It solves a common problem - job market information for data roles is often scattered and hard to understand. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings* (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project brings everything together in one simple and easy-to-use place to explore job trends and pay.
